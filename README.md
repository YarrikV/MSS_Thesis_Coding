# MSS_Thesis_Coding

This repositories combines some of the coding I have done while working on my thesis during the advanced Master of Space Studies at KU Leuven. The Thesis was a study on "Magnetic flux erosion of coronal mass ejections on ambient solar wind using EUHFORIA".

The data are simulation using the [EUHFORIA model](https://euhforia.com/) which simulates the heliosphere between the Sun and Mars.
The data set contained a total of 27 simulations and had a size of more than 50 GB.
This large data set was processed using the [Tecplot software](https://www.tecplot.com/).
Afterwards, additional analysis was done using python (and Jupyter notebooks).

## Overview of the code

- `data_analysis` Code used for analysis of the data generated by the other scripts. This data was >50GB and is thus not included in this repository.

- `tecplot_files` Files used in tecplot directly. These include files which set a certain colormap or determine the visual representation. These files are used before an image is exported or an animation is recorded.

- `tecplot_macros` Files containing macros for use with Tecplot. This was only used in the beginning of my research in favor of the more capable Pytecplot.

- `tecplot_pytecplot` Files containing [Pytecplot code](https://tecplot.azureedge.net/products/pytecplot/docs/index.html#). An "Euhforia_Run" class was written to analyse my data more efficiently.
